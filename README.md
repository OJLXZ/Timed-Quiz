# Timed-Quiz

HTML is initially worked on.
CSS and JS sheets are created and linked to HTML sheet.
Divsm and other tags are created within the body of the HTML and individually given and ID.

On CSS sheet, fonts were customized.
Start-button and submit-button were customized in size, font, color.

IDs from HTML were converted to variables.
Timer was setup with eventListener
Questions array was created.
An attempt to a for loop for questions to populate were not successful,
and scores div with an functioning "SUBMIT" button were not successful.

Obviously, this was as far as I could add to this quiz.
I was unable to connect the references from google foo and lectures together to complete this quiz.
